# Game of War (Simple version)!⚠️🪖

- This is a simplified version of Game of War with a deck
- Worked with external API to get the deck and draw the cards
- Made this project to boost my Async JavaScript Knowledge

### About the Game🃏

- The game will have 2 players, one is the computer and the other is the user
- Initially a new deck should be loaded to start the game
- Once the deck is ready, user can click the draw button which draws 2 cards one for computer and one for the user itself
- Based on the cards drawn score will be counted
- Cards can be drawn until the deck is empty. The number of cards are indicated on the screen
- After all the cards are drawn, the player with majority round wins takes the game!
